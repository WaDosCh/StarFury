/**
 * Definition object for fixtures. A fixture represents the bridge between
 * geometry and entities. A single instance of this class may be used in the
 * construction of multiple entities.
 * <p>
 * A fixture definition consists of a {@link Convex} shape, an identifier and a
 * relative density coefficient. The identifier and the density coefficient are
 * both optional. An identifier allows later interactions with a fixture of a
 * {@link PhysicsEntity}. The identifier must be unique within an entity. The
 * density coefficient allows adjustment of the fixture density. The real
 * density is calculated from the entity mass, but the density coefficients of
 * the fixtures determine the mass distribution. If no custom mass distribution
 * is required the default density coefficient of 1 should be used. A fixture
 * can also be defined as a sensor. Collisions with sensors are not resolved,
 * but detected.
