 * Common base interface for all lockable objects.

 * <p>
 * Locking an object is a way to programmatically make a previously mutable
 * object immutable. The object implementation should make sure that once locked
 * no mutation of the object state is allowed. Also unlocking a locked object
 * must not be possible since that would allow future alteration of a locked
 * object, violating the immutability constraint.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It is recommended that modification attempts on a locked object yield an
 * exception - preferably an {@link IllegalStateException}. This is also the
 * default implementation for the {@link #enforceLock()} method.
